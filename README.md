# This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## About My project

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I **love** and **need** it
- I am interested in learning about everything in Stats course

My goals for this course:
1. Learn how to create memes with R
2. Master Markdown and GitHub

Check out [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for more about R programming.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media.tenor.com/GUhnxCpzr78AAAAM/mike-ohearn-baby-dont-hurt-me.gif)
